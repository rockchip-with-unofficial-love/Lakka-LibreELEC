Subject: [PATCH] GBMUtils: LockFrontBuffer should return the front of queue

We are using emplace to add to back of queue, and pop to remove from front.
We should be returning the buffer from front of queue, not the one just added.

I believe we are currently only using 2 buffers, when mesa makes 4 available
